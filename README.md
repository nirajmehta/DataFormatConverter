# DataFormatConverter
CSV to JSON, JSON to CSV converter 

I have created this project using Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition, and .Net Core 3.1 console application.

I have used following nuget packages in this project    
  Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection Version="6.0.0",
	ChoETL.JSON.NETStandard Version="1.2.1.42",
	Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Console Version="6.0.0",
	Newtonsoft.Json Version="13.0.1"

I have used ChoETL nuget package to convert CSV to JSON and vice versa. It can also be used for XML conversions. 
It is open source, also it's very concise. It works with the nested JSON/XML objects.
